   * 
   * <ol>
   * <li>SERVER_IP: The IP address of the computer running the server application. This will be your
   * own laptop, until the beta beta demo or competition where this is the TA or professor's laptop.
   * In that case, set the IP to the default (indicated in Resources).</li>
   * <li>TEAM_NUMBER: your project team number.</li>
   * </ol>
   * 
   * <p>Note: You can disable printing from the Wi-Fi code via ENABLE_DEBUG_WIFI_PRINT.
